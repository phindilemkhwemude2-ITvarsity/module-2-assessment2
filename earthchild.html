        <h3>EARTHCHILD</h3>
        <br/><br/>
        <p>EarthChild is South Africa's leading kid's organic fashion brand, which offers a clothing range known for its style, comfort and quality. All garments are made from cool and natural breathable fabrics and it caters to kids from when they are born, up to the age of 10. Co-founder, Jonni Katz, recognised the untapped demand for high-quality leisurewear produced from natural fibres. Earthchild stays true to that original vision by designing classic, timeless garments that are modern, comfortable and made from high-quality fabrics. The design and supply chain teams oversee the entire manufacturing process from start to finish.</p>
